# Title : Task List
A task list made to practice HTML and vanilla JavaScipt and saving to local storage.
## Motivation.
One of the first things beginners do is creating their task list, this is my take on it, a simple app useful in everyday life.
## Build status.
Finished, not going to add anything more, maybe only change local storage to a server at some point, if I get to doing back end.
## Tech/framework used.
HTML, vanilla Javascript, materialize framework.
